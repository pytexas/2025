## Tutorials

### Python Tools in the Real World

Learning Python’s syntax and features is just the beginning. When it’s time to build software that others can use, understanding Python’s rich ecosystem of tools becomes essential. This 3-hour hands-on tutorial introduces you to powerful tools that bridge the gap between writing code and developing real-world applications. You’ll gain practical experience with tools like venv, pypi, black, mypy, cookiecutter, and Python’s debugging and logging facilities.
This is a hands-on tutorial with several mini projects to learn enough about these tools that you can continue to teach yourself later. We will cover:

* **Virtual Environments**: Learn how to create and manage isolated environments using venv and pyenv, and understand their critical role in application development.
* **Package Management**: Master pip for installing and managing dependencies from PyPI, evaluate third-party packages, and demystify Python’s packaging ecosystem.
* **Project Templates with Cookiecutter**: Discover how to streamline project setup and create your own reusable Python package templates.
* **Static Code Analysis**: Use Black and Ruff to format and lint your code, and seamlessly integrate these tools into your preferred editor.
* **Type Checking with Mypy**: Learn to add type hints and use mypy for early detection of runtime errors, enhancing code quality and reliability.
* **Debugging and Logging**: Dive into Python’s debugger and logging module, and see how to use them effectively in Visual Studio Code, Jupyter Notebooks, and the terminal.

You'll leave this tutorial with concrete experience working with these tools, ready to apply them to your projects and continue your learning journey. And you'll also leave with a renewed excitement about the vast world that Python's ecosystem offers.

### The new wave of Python Packaging

Python has become the #1 programming language on GitHub (ranked by number of individual contributors) in 2024. Such a popular language deserves the very best when it comes to the developer experience when shipping your code. While this hasn't historically been the case, we made huge steps towards this in 2024.

In this workshop, I will introduce you to the TL;DR ("too long, didn't read") version of how you should handle Python packaging in 2025. You will learn about the current best practices when it comes packaging either your favorite library or your fancy new web application. Note, this session will focus on using the PyPI ecosystem, not the Conda ecosystem (at least not today).
