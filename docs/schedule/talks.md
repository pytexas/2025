## Verbs, Not Nouns: Writing Documentation Users Want to Read

Lots of documentation is dull and tough to read.
That's because most documentation focuses on describing product features, and those are nouns.
Your user's primary concern isn't what your product is, or how it's made.
Your user has a problem they want to solve, and they want to know how to use your product to do that.
They're looking for a verb. In this talk, you'll find the verbs that go with your nouns, and how that translates into readable documentation.

## The Pythonic Ideal in the Age of Generative AI

The advent of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) programs,
such as ChatGPT,
and code pair programming tools,
such as GitHub Copilot,
has ushered in concerns about whether or not it is still valuable to learn to write code,
or to continue to improve our ability to write idiomatic, beautiful code.
The reality is that generative AI programs can write code that is poor quality or incorrect.
In addition, generative AI is still in its infancy and cannot yet replace human innovation or innate expertise for complex tasks,
such as writing Pythonic code.
Do we need to be worried about AI taking over coding jobs?
This talk will cover why learning to write Pythonic code is still a valuable skill to pursue,
and will introduce techniques to add generative AI and pair programming AI tools into your teaching (and learning!).

## Typed and Decorated Python GUIs: Help the Language Help You

Python's increasingly powerful type annotations
(and the type checkers and IDEs that consume them)
are a great way to manage the complexities of Python GUI programming.
This talk will walk through a `strict`ly typed PyQt/PySide GUI application skeleton while touching on custom `logging` handlers,
`enum`-based error passing, type-aware `match` statements,
and how generic types empower function decorators, decorator factories, and class decorators.

## Building a test framework from scratch (or not)!

`pytest` is a fantastic test framework, but why use it when you can just build your own test framework _from scratch_?
Sounds wild, right? Well, it is!
In this talk, we will learn what testing in Python is all about
by iteratively building features of a framework from the ground up.
Through this, we will learn not just _what_ goes into a test framework
but _why_ those features are there - the runner, the structure, the assertions, and more.
We will develop a deep understanding of how test frameworks work
and also how to write _good_ tests with them.
We will also gain immense appreciation for mature test frameworks like `pytest`
that save our time by providing off-the-shelf testing features that deliver serious value.

## LLMs as Bug Hunters: Leveraging LLMs to Discover Python Vulnerabilities

Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing how we think about software security,
making it possible to discover vulnerabilities that evade traditional tools.
Melding the powers of AI understanding code semantics with Python's flexibility,
we can develop tooling to track complex input/output paths,
reveal multi-step exploits, and make code safer.
This session will examine how Python is being used to create
state-of-the-art vulnerability detection tools that harness LLMs to find new, previously undiscovered security bugs.

## Place-making and productivity: Build maintainable broad-scale tools with a small team

As we bring on new team members, we want to ensure they can ramp up quickly and have a good experience.
They should be able to understand "the company way" of accomplishing things
and quickly find the tools they need to do their job.
Veteran team members should also be able to codify and commoditize the patterns
they've developed over time so they can focus on higher-order problems.
In large organizations, such tooling might be the purview of a dedicated platform engineering team
and have a budget to match.
But what if you're a small team, or a team of one,
and you want to build something that scales to the whole organization without becoming a full-time job?
At ITHAKA, over 100 engineering staff manage hundreds of applications in a handful of languages and frameworks across many teams and products.
Despite the variety, most of those engineers still need to perform a core set of tasks when developing,
from debugging to traffic routing to feature toggles.
Teams are always working on high-priority projects,
and it can be difficult to find the time to take stock of things that can be better streamlined or automated.
Further, although we have a platform engineering team,
as a non-profit we don't have the budget for someone to work on meta-tooling as a full-time job.
Over time, several aspects of our development process have become common sources of friction,
with a lot of time spent answering questions or debugging local machine setups.
In this talk I'll tell the story of my journey to build a tool with a net positive return on investment,
from the initial idea to the rollout and adoption.
I'll cover the principles that guided my decisions, the tools we use, and the outcomes we've seen so far.

## Signal Processing in Electrochemistry with Python: Applications to the US Opioids Crisis

With an average of 195 daily deaths due to synthetic opioids overdose in 2021,
the US have been facing an unprecedented opioids crisis.
Fentanyl and its analogues have been a major source of concern, due to their high levels of addiction,
fast-acting mechanisms, and detection challenges.
Fast, effective, and accurate identification and quantification of fentanyl, its analogues,
and metabolites are essential to help prevent overdose-related incidents and to enable agile medical response.
Although electrochemical sensors represent a promising technology for selectively detecting opioids at low concentrations,
analyzing and processing the data remains one of the major challenges.
To tackle this challenge, certain Python libraries, such as _scipy.signal_,
could be useful in processing signals with high levels of noise and interference from other substances.
This talk will focus on specific examples of how such libraries could help enable filtering,
Fourier transformation, and wavelet analysis of electrochemical data.
As examples, code snippets and outputs will be shown
to demonstrate how Python can help improve the quality and usability of electrochemical data.
Additionally, this talk will show how data processing can further benefit from hyper parameter optimization techniques,
enabled by libraries like _hyperopt_ and _ray-tune_.
By doing so, my hope is to demonstrate how Python could be extremely useful
in helping address problems at the intersection of statistics, public health, and public policy.

## Demystifying the World of Serializers (and Deserializers) for SQLAlchemy ORM Models in Python

SQLAlchemy simplifies SQL model creation and manipulation using Python.
However, efficient data transmission requires serialization of Python objects for network interactions and database storage.
Serialization transforms data for transmission and storage,
which are crucial in database procedures.
In this talk, we will explore configurable (de)serialization tools to enhance SQLAlchemy ORM model's capabilities,
their advanced use cases, and implementation.
We will also compare this to the features of commonly-used serializer alternatives,
such as SerializerMixin, Marshmallow-SQLAlchemy, ColanderAlchemy, Serialchemy, SQLAthanor, and more.

## Python meets the crab - Friendship at first sight?

Python's simplicity often comes at the cost of performance,
especially in computationally-intensive tasks.
In contrast, Rust enables one to write low-level code that takes full advantage of the underlying hardware.
Furthermore, Rust (just like Python) has a vibrant ecosystem with many great libraries.
PyO3 (together with the maturin build back-end) allows you to easily integrate the two languages together and make use of the best of both.

## Generators: The Unsung Hero of Async Programming

Async is often about tackling IO-bound, high concurrency work, but it can also be about long running, interruptible work. While we frequently think about generators in the context of iterators, generators are a great fit in any scenario where the function needs to be interruptible and resumable. In this talk, we’ll take a fresh look at generators and look at how we used them to build a durable orchestration framework.

## Hot: pathlib, Not: string paths

Have you seen `pathlib`? If not, once I show you, you will never go back to string paths and `os.path` ever again! `pathlib` turns paths into path objects, which have attributes and methods that cover a number of operations. In this talk, we will:

- Talk about how to create `Path` objects, and how this differs on Windows vs Mac/Linux
- Talk about the many properties of pure paths
- Talk about folder operations from `Path` objects, such as creating directory structures and recursive globbing.
- Talk about file operations, made simpler with `Path` objects, such as reading contents, getting properties like file size, and deleting.

Stop messing with string paths and get with `pathlib`!

## Demystifying AI Agents with Python Code

Everyone’s talking about AI Agents! But what are they, and how can you build them? In this talk, you will learn about how AI Agents are defined, and their key components, including LLMs, tools, and memory. Moving beyond abstract definitions, I will show you how you can implement AI Agents in Python using the OpenAI Python SDK along with basic Python concepts like functions, while loops, and if statements. From there I will demonstrate how Microsoft’s open-source AutoGen framework abstracts away some of the Python boilerplate for you, allowing for simpler setup when you are working with many agents at once. By the end, you will be empowered to create your own agents that access your own APIs to complete tasks that you define.
