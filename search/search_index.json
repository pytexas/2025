If you can only attend a portion of the conference in person, you can still participate in the rest of the conference virtually. Follow the instructions on the virtual attendance for instructions to do this.   </p> Can I get a discount for volunteering or speaking? <p>Accepted speakers will get a free ticket to the event. </p> What is your refund policy? <p>In the event of cancellation prior to 7 days before the conference, registration  fees will be fully refunded. After this time period, we will refund 50% of the registration price. For any pre-order items (e.g. t-shirts), orders  will be refunded if cancellation happens before the production order is made.</p> How much of my sponsorship or ticket price goes to the conference? <p>The short answer is: as much as is needed. Our goal each year is to put on the best conference we can muster. In the event that we gather more funds from sponsorship or ticket sales than we need for the conference, we simply roll the remainder over to the next year. This helps us build a sustainable offering that Texas Python developers can rely on year after year.</p> <p>We aspire eventually to use excess funds to support outreach programs, day care for conference attendees who are parents, scholarships for underprivileged attendees, and other worthy expenses that further the goals of the PyTexas Foundation. We welcome your input on how we can best assist the Texas Python community!</p> My organization doesn't use Python. Why should I sponsor PyTexas? <p>There are several reasons to consider sponsoring the PyTexas conference even if your organization doesn't currently use Python. First, you should consider using Python! It's a remarkably flexible language that has established libraries for and applications in web development, data science, science at large, and more.</p> <p>Second, the trend in modern software development is toward polyglot programming. That is, the best developers are competent in multiple languages and prefer to \"pick the right tool for the job.\" Polyglot programmers can bring to the table idioms and architectures that aren't apparent to developers steeped in only one technology. Even if your organization primarily uses Go or Ruby, you can increase your recruiting reach and encourage internal innovation by hiring smart developers -- regardless of what language they work in today. You can even make this part of your presence at the conference! Feel free to submit a \"X for Pythonistas\" talk; we promise it will get due consideration.</p> Is my contribution to PyTexas tax-deductible? <p>The PyTexas Foundation was organized as a Texas non-profit corporation in 2014 and received its 501(c)(3) recognition in early 2015. Although we cannot guarantee that your contribution to PyTexas will be tax-deductible (we aren\u2019t tax attorneys and just don\u2019t know), you can rest assured that any contributions to the organization will always be used to further the common goals of the Texas Python community, and never for personal benefit.</p>"},{"location":"reg/","title":"Reg","text":"<p>Redirect file.

In addition, generative AI is still in its infancy and cannot yet replace human innovation or innate expertise for complex tasks, such as writing Pythonic code.

They should be able to understand \"the company way\" of accomplishing things and quickly find the tools they need to do their job. Veteran team members should also be able to codify and commoditize the patterns they've developed over time so they can focus on higher-order problems. In large organizations, such tooling might be the purview of a dedicated platform engineering team and have a budget to match. But what if you're a small team, or a team of one, and you want to build something that scales to the whole organization without becoming a full-time job? At ITHAKA, over 100 engineering staff manage hundreds of applications in a handful of languages and frameworks across many teams and products. Despite the variety, most of those engineers still need to perform a core set of tasks when developing, from debugging to traffic routing to feature toggles. Teams are always working on high-priority projects, and it can be difficult to find the time to take stock of things that can be better streamlined or automated. Further, although we have a platform engineering team, as a non-profit we don't have the budget for someone to work on meta-tooling as a full-time job. Over time, several aspects of our development process have become common sources of friction, with a lot of time spent answering questions or debugging local machine setups.

Fentanyl and its analogues have been a major source of concern, due to their high levels of addiction, fast-acting mechanisms, and detection challenges. Fast, effective, and accurate identification and quantification of fentanyl, its analogues, and metabolites are essential to help prevent overdose-related incidents and to enable agile medical response. Although electrochemical sensors represent a promising technology for selectively detecting opioids at low concentrations, analyzing and processing the data remains one of the major challenges. To tackle this challenge, certain Python libraries, such as scipy.signal, could be useful in processing signals with high levels of noise and interference from other substances. This talk will focus on specific examples of how such libraries could help enable filtering, Fourier transformation, and wavelet analysis of electrochemical data. As examples, code snippets and outputs will be shown to demonstrate how Python can help improve the quality and usability of electrochemical data. Additionally, this talk will show how data processing can further benefit from hyper parameter optimization techniques, enabled by libraries like hyperopt and ray-tune.

It is the oldest regional Python conference in North America, and possibly the world. Typically, we draw famous Python speakers as well as regional and local Python experts to teach attendees about Python and related technologies.</p> <p>On average, we sell out our venue and have 200-250 attendees a year.</p>"},{"location":"sponsors/sponsor-us/#2024-demographics","title":"2024 Demographics","text":"<p>We had guests from all over the world, though our audience primarily is in Texas.</p> <p> </p> <p>We primarily get software engineers and other engineering fields, though we had some leadership and management folks attend.</p> <p></p> <p>Also, we have a fairly even spread of experience.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"sponsors/sponsor-us/#how-we-use-the-funds","title":"How We Use The Funds","text":"<p>All sponsorship funds are used for the benefit of the PyTexas Conference and Foundation and the Texas Python community. We utilize funds to pay our venue, vendors, supplies, and all other things conference related. Any surplus funds that we collect are used to fund the minimal operating cost of the Foundation for the remainder of the year (primarily costs around bookkeeping, email, and foundation governance), as well as make next year\u2019s PyTexas better.</p> <p>Also, in an attempt to make PyTexas as accessible as possible to everyone, we subsidize our Individual ticket prices with Corporate tickets and Sponsorship funds. By doing this we are able to keep PyTexas Individual tickets as low as possible, ensuring that everyone can attend. If an attendee can\u2019t afford a ticket, they can apply for a grant where we can offer them free tickets and sometimes funds for travel expenses.</p> <p>Thank you for considering to sponsor PyTexas.</p> <p>If you\u2019re interested in sponsoring PyTexas, please reach out to sponsorship@pytexas.org.</p>"}]}
